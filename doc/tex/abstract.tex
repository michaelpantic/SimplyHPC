The demand for computational power and storage in industry and academia is continously increasing. A main driver of this demand is the increased use of numerical simulations, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for product development in a Big Data regime. This type of simulations generates huge amounts of data and demands massively parallel computing power. Traditionally, this computational power is provided by large on-premises clusters, which require large investments in hardware and maintenance. The large costs, the lack of flexibility and a high complexity prevent small and medium sized companies from implementing such clusters. Cloud computing has become a viable alternative, offering more flexibility at significant lower costs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that large scale numerical simulations, requiring parallel computing, are feasible on Microsoft Azure. In order to simplify the deployment and set up of such simulations, a custom cloud orchestrator, SimplyHPC, has been developed. Using this tool, we have been able to succesfully run the widely accepted solvers, namely PETSc and ANSYS CFX, in a performant and scalable manner on Microsoft Azure. It has been shown that the cloud computing performance is comparable to on-premises clusters in terms of efficiency and scalability.
