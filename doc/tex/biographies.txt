Henrik Nordborg, Dr. sc. nat. ETZH

Henrik Nordborg received his PhD in Theoretical Physics form the ETH in Zurich in 1997. The topic of the thesis was the phenomenological properties of high-temperature superconductors. He then spent 3 years at Argonne National Laboratory before joining ABB Corporate Research in Switzerland in 2000, where he was in charge of numerical simulations of power devices. In particular, he specialized in simulation of electrical arcs in circuit breakers. Since 2010 he is a professor at the HSR University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland, where he is active in the areas of energy technology, computational fluid dynamics, and plasma simulations.
